Why Rust
 - Good balance between low level verbosity and high level productivity
 - Rust has a focus on safety and speed
 - Great memory safety
 - Automatic garbage collection
 - Rust won the first place for Most Loved Programming Language of 2016 in the Stack Overflow Developer Survey !!! :)

Ownership
 - Variable bindings have ownership of what they’re bound to
 - let v = vec![1,2,3];
	 - v comes into scope
	 - vector is created on stack
	 - space for elements is allocated on heap
	 - v goes out of scope -> Rust cleans stack and heap of v
 - exactly one binding has ownership of resource
 - let v2 = v;
	 - shallow copy of v created on stack but not in heap
	 - so now v cannot be used: v2 is the only valid connection to v

References and Borrowing
 - let v2 = &v;
	 - using & makes v2 a reference to v
	 - this lets it borrow ownership (resource not deallocated once v2 is out of scope)
	 - allows you to continue referring to v once v2 is out of scope
 - let v2 = &mut v;
	 - makes a mutable reference to v (in Rust, all variable bindings are immutable by default)
	 - in order to do this, v must have been declared as mutable ( let mut v = vec![1,2,3]; )
 - Use & to create a reference (get the memory address of a resource), and use * to dereference (get the resource located at memory address)

borrowing: the rulez
 - any borrow must last for a scope no greater than that of the owner
 - you may have one or the other of these two kinds of borrows, but not both at the same time:
	 - one or more references (&T) to a resource
	 - exactly one mutable reference (&mut T)
 - avoids a data race

Lifetimes
 - Why they are useful
	 - I acquire a handle to resource x
	 - I lend you a reference to resource x (let’s call it y)
	 - I am done with x and deallocate it
	 - You decide to use y (which uses x)
	 - Dangling pointer (C: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, Rust: Nuh uh!)
 - Lifetime: the scope that a reference is valid for, or how long the resource lives
 - Scope of a reference: think of it as from the curly brace before it to the one matching that

elided lifetimes: the rulez
 - When elided (implicit) lifetimes are valid:
	 - Each elided lifetime in a function’s arguments becomes a distinct lifetime parameter (so, one distinct unsaid lifetime parameter per argument).
	 - If there is exactly one input lifetime, that lifetime is assigned to all elided lifetimes in the return values of that function.
	 - If there are multiple input lifetimes, but one of them is &self or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.
